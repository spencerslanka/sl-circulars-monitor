Maintenance of Government Vehicles  
 
Your attention is drawn to Public Administration Circular 30/2016 dated 29.12.2016 issued on 
the Maintenance of Government Vehicles and this circular is issued to be effective from 
01.03.2026 with the inclusion of new provisions in place of the provisions stipulated in the said 
circular on the manner in which actions should be taken with regard to the maintenance of 
government vehicles.   
 
02. 
Accordingly, consumption of fuel, granting advance for purchase of fuel and maintenance 
of running charts should be performed in the following manner. 
 
2.1 The consumption of fuel must be re-tested after a period of 12 months from each fuel 
test or after running a distance of 25,000 km or after carrying out a major repair to the 
engine, whichever occurs first. For that purpose, a full tank of fuel must be put in and 
80 km must be run both inside and outside of the city. Thereafter, the tank should be re-
filled fully. The amount of fuel burnt per kilometer can be worked out by dividing the 
number of kilometers run by the number of liters that had to be put in to fill the tank the 
second time. 
 
2.2  In case where any Ministry or Department maintains a pool of vehicles and when it is 
required to use those vehicles/ one of those vehicles for duties which require to run a 
distance more than 100 km (a total of 200 km for both ways), fuel should be filled by 
way of giving an advance to the officer who is authorized to use the vehicle. 
 
2.3  A chart must be maintained with regard to the vehicles in the form as in the annexure. 
The format gives the amount of fuel used since the date on which consumption of fuel 
was tested and the amount of fuel used over the previous month. If there is any sharp 
adverse variation, the Staff Officer of a Ministry/ Department/ Institution who is in 
charge of vehicles should get the vehicle examined immediately in order to check 
whether the cause for such adverse variance is a mechanical defect or malpractice.  
 
2.4  The daily running chart should be properly completed and get the signature of the 
officer who has used the vehicle at the end of every journey. The Staff Officer in charge

where it is revealed at an inquiry that action has not been taken in the said manner,

vehicle immediately upon completion of the relevant task and the Staff Officer in 
charge of the subject of vehicles must conduct regular inspections to ensure the same. It
