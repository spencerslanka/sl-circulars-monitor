Revision of Salaries of the Public Service 2025 - Preparing Letters of Salary 
Conversion by using salary2025 Software  
 
The guidance required for revision of salaries of the public service has been given by Public 
Administration Circular 10/2025 dated 25.03.2025 as per Budget Proposals 2025. The 
Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government has 
introduced the salary2025 software to support the process of preparing salaries for a large 
number of employees in a short period of time.  
 
02.  
The salary2025 software can be accessed in the following manner. 
 
a.) 
In cases where the internet facilities are provided through LGN 10.250.1.112:9006  
 b.) 
In cases where the internet facilities are provided through other networks 
43.224.125.68:9006  
 
03.  
The salary2025 software can be logged in through the Institutional Login via the 
above links. The passwords already provided for the institutions to log in to the MISCO software 
should be used for this purpose. If the password for an institution has not yet been obtained, the Head 
of the respective Institution can obtain the relevant password by sending an email to 
salary.2025.lk@gmail.com 
 
04.  
If the respective institution is not listed in the relevant Institutional Login, a new 
Institutional Login can be obtained by contacting the aforementioned salary.2025.lk@gmail.com 
to obtain the password for the login relevant to the institution.

the Help link in its interface for instructions on using it, in order to minimize the issues with 
regard to the use of salary2025 software.

This software has been introduced solely with the objective of facilitating the process 
of salary conversion in institutions and I hereby emphasize that it is the responsibility of the 
relevant authorities to place the signature after verifying the accuracy of the salary conversion 
(Annex 01 of Public Administration Circular 10/2025 dated 25.03.2025) of an officer by 
comparing it with the personal file.  
 
07.  
If it is discovered that a salary conversion prepared using this software is not accurate 
upon examining the relevant salary circulars, you are further informed to notify the Director 
of Establishments with immediate effect via telephone number 011-2693374 or 
salary.2025.lk@gmail.com to examine the reason for the same and make the necessary 
changes to the software.
